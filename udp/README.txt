To build the files: make server; make client; make allTo remove the executables: make cleanTo run the client side: ./client <ip address> <port #>To run the server side: ./serve <port #>Commands:       ls – get the loist of files in the server local directory      exit – the server will shut down      put <filename> - the client will send a file to the server to be stored in ‘temp’      get <filename> - client will request a file from the server and store in ‘temp’The ‘get’ and ‘put’ commands do not transfer the entire file. I am hung up on a few characters. This means all image files will not open since they do not have all the necessary characters.  The exit and ls commands do work completely.
